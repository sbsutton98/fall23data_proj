# fall23data_proj
A class project that looked at walkability in LA and compared it to rates of crime in different police zones. 


A class for PPD 534 at USC. A group project involving 3 other people. Most coding was done by me, from cleaning and prepping to running models at the end of the class. 

The files are going to be split up by class assignment. It may seem disjointed, especially since at the end of it, the final incorporated many of the earlier files practices. 

Assignment 1 is the introduction to crime data, using it to visualize crime data that impacts pedestrians in the City of Los Angeles. Originally done in Google Colab, so the visualizations would appear front and center. If going through it, I would recommend running it in Google Colab. The break between large chunks in the file can be run in each cell as one goes through it. 



I will write some more here as I update the code, as a longer guide to the rest of it.
